Paint a picture/text defined as png  into the air. 

Included is a converter converting a png (resolution x:11) to a json object, which can be light painted. 

In favor of choosing the animation the flipping options from "cyberband" where removed.   
Instead you can cycle through animations located in "anims", with LEFT and RIGHT buttons.  

The name of an animation is shown on display, "SELECT" activates shown animation which starts after 3 seconds and loops till a Button is pressed.  

Hold card10 in a way that the LEDS point in moving direction and move it from your right to your left. 
The opposit viewer/cam should see it moving from left to right.
